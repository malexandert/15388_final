    "For our project, we would like to collect data to see if voter preferences correlate to how affected certain populations were by the Great Recession. We can measure “recession effect” in a number of different ways. For example, we can use statistics from the US Bureau of Labor to map certain geographical areas, and we can compare statistics from pre-2008 and post-2008 to view how the recession affected jobs in those regions. From there, we could look at polls or voter data to see how those regions voted in either the 2010 midterm elections or the 2012 Presidential election. Comparing these two sets of data, we would be interested in finding out which parties/administrations people blamed more for the recession, and whether or not voting habits changed in areas most affected by the recession, and why"

    "This sounds good, but because political landscapes are changing constantly, it is difficult to assign certain changes as being \"caused\" to the 2008 recession as opposed to just brought on by other factors that happen to correlate with areas hit by the recession (the classic correlation/causation issue). But if you keep this fact in mind, then I think the analysis can be interesting."
